* Improved if_permitted_to syntax:  if the attribute is left out, permissions are checked on for the current object

* Added #has_role_with_hierarchy? method to retrieve explicit and calculated roles [jeremyf]

* Added a simple rules analyzer to help improve authorization rules [sb]

* Gemified plugin.  Needed to restructure the lib path contents [sb]

* Added handling of Authorization::AuthorizationInController::ClassMethods.filter_access_to parameters that are of the form [:show, :update] instead of just :show, :update. [jeremyf]

* Added authorization usage helper for checking filter_access_to usage in controllers [sb]

* Added a authorization rules browser.  See README for more information [sb]

* Added Model.using_access_control? to check if a model has model security activated [sb]

* Changed Authorization::ObligationScope#map_table_alias_for [Brian Langenfeld]
  * Fixed to prevent bad aliases from being produced.

* Changed Authorization::Attribute#validate? [Brian Langenfeld]
  * Encountering a nil value when evaluating an attribute now raises a NilAttributeValueError, instead of an AuthorizationError.  We leave it to the caller to decide what to do about it.

* Changed Authorization::Engine#permit! [Brian Langenfeld]
  * We now convert incoming privileges to symbols (e.g. 'read' is made equivalent to :read).  This ensures the privileges will match those defined in the authorization rules file.
  * The method now properly infers context when checking against an association (e.g. user.posts).  We do this by leveraging ActiveRecord builder method 'new' to instantiate a proper object we can work with.
  * When testing rules for positive results (via Authorization::Attribute#validate?), we now rescue NilAttributeValueError exceptions, simply causing the rule to return a negative result (instead of barfing).

* Changed Authorization::ObligationScope#rebuild_join_options! [Brian Langenfeld]
  * If we're dealing with multiple obligations we have to check (i.e. ones that result in OR'd conditions), we now use :include instead of :joins for our generated scope.  This does seem like a kludge, but until ActiveRecord scopes support unions (for checking obligations individually and consolidating the results), we don't have much choice.  Something to revisit later, for sure.
